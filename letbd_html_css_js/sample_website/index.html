    <h1>Important HTML tags</h1>

    <p>
        This page is designed as a quick reference for some of the common tags
        covered in <a href="http://learnenough.com/html-tutorial"><em>Learn Enough HTML
        to Be Dangerous</em></a>. In the process of making it, we'll learn how to make HTML
        <em>tables</em> via <code>table</code> and related tags.
    </p>
    <p>
        The tables below don't include all HTML tags, but they do list many of the most important ones.

    <h1>The Learn Enough Story</h1>
    <p>
        Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach 
        <em> technical sophistication</em>, the seemingly magical ability
        to take command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. 
        This includes everything from command lines and coding to guessing
        keyboard shortcuts, Googling error messages, and knowing when to just
        reboot the darn thing. We believe there are <strong>at least a billion
        people</strong> who can benefit from learning technical sophistication,
        probably more. To join our movement,

        HTML was created by the original "web developer", computer scientist
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a>.
        It's not true that Sir Tim invented HTML in order to share pictures of his cat,
        but it would be cool if it were.

            In addition to hosting most of the world's supply of kittenvideos, the
            Web is also full of inspiring quotes, perhaps none more so thanthis one:
        </p>
        <blockquote style="padding: 2px 20px; background: #d7d5d5;">
        <p>
            <em>Don't believe every quote you read on the Internet.</em><br>- Abraham Lincoln
        </p>

    <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
            Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is an outgrowth of the <a href="http://railstutorial.org/">Ruby
            on Rails Tutorial</a> and the <a href="http://www.softcover.io/">Softcover publishing platform</a>.
            This page is part of the sample site for     
            <a href="http://learnenough.com/html-tutorial"><em>Learn Enough HTML to Be Dangerous</em></a>,
            which teaches the basics of <strong>H</strong>yper<strong>T</strong>ext <strong>M</strong>arkup
            <strong>L</strong>anguage, the universal language of the World Wide Web.

    <h2>Founders</h2>
        <p>
            Learn Enough to Be Dangerous was founded in 2015 by Michael Hartl, Lee 
            Donahoe, and Nick Merwin. We believe that the kind of technical sophistication 
            taught by the Learn Enough tutorials can benefit at least a billion people,
            and probably more.

    <h3>Michael Hartl</h3>
        <p>
            Michael is the creator of the <a href="http://railstutorial.org/"> Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a>
            and principal author of the <a href="http://learnenough.com/">Learn Enough to Be Dangerous</a>
            introductory sequence. He is an advanced student of
            <a href="http://kravmaga.com/">Krav Maga</a> and has a three-step plan for world domination.
            Rumors that he's secretly a supervillain are slightly exaggerated.

    <h3>Lee Donahoe</h3>
        <p>
            When he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting powder stashes on his snowboard, you can 
            find Lee in front of his computer designing interfaces, doing front-end development, or writing some
            of the interface-related Learn Enough tutorials.

    <h3>Nick Merwin</h3>
        <p>
            You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on Jimmy Kimmel, Conan, 
            or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true nerd at heart. He's just as happy shredding
            well-spec'd lines of code from a tour bus as he is from his kitchen table.
