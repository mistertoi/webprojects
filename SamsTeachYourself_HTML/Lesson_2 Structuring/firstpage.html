        In the beginning, Tim created the HyperText Markup Language.
        The Internet was without form and void, and text was upon the
        face of the monitor and the Hands of Tim were moving over the
        face of the keyboard. And Tim said, Let there be links; and
        there were links. And Tim saw that the links were good; and
        Tim separated the links from the text. Tim called the links
        Anchors, and the text He called Other Stuff. And the whole
        thing together was the first Web Page.
