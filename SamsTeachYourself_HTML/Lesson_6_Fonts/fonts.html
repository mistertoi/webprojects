<!--The <pre> tag causes text to appear in a monospaced font—and it does something else unique
and useful. As you learned in Lesson 2, “Structuring an HTML Document,” multiple spaces and
line breaks are normally ignored in HTML files, but <pre> causes exact spacing and line breaks
to be preserved. For example, without <pre>, the text at the end of Figure 6.2 would look like the
following:
Even if you added <br> tags at the end of every line, the columns wouldn’t line up properly.
However, when you put <pre> at the beginning and </pre> at the end, the columns line up
properly because the exact spaces are kept; no <br> tags are needed. The <pre> tag gives you
a quick and easy way to preserve the alignment of any monospaced text files you might want to
transfer to a web page with minimum effort.-->
